This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in React Native's FlatList component: the improper use or omission of the `key` prop.  The `FlatListBug.js` file shows a problematic implementation where the `key` prop is missing, leading to unpredictable rendering behavior.  `FlatListBugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with unique keys, resolving the rendering issues.  The README file explains the error and how to avoid it. Understanding how to correctly use the `key` prop within FlatList is critical for building performant and stable React Native applications.
